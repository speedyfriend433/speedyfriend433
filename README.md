# 👨‍💻 speedyfriend67

Hi! I'm **speedyfriend67** — a curious iOS reverse engineer, creative Swift developer, and bug bounty hunter 🧪. I explore Apple internals, make PoCs, design custom tools, and build security-focused apps from scratch. Always learning, always shipping.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 🍎 **iOS Security Research**
  - Bug bounties via Apple Security Bounty program
  - Reverse engineering with IDA Pro & Ghidra
  - Mach-O parsing, No-JIT hooking, kernel fuzzing, and PoCs

- 🧰 **iOS App Development**
  - Building SwiftUI apps for iOS: from IPA signers to UniGram (campus notification app)
  - Tools for Mach-O analysis, IPA injection, and APK analysis (Pure Swift!)
  - Using ElleKit, zsign-ios, MachOKit, and more

- 🎮 **3D Web Experiments**
  - Minecraft-style world builder [Alony 🌍]
  - Geometry Dash-like game w/ realistic physics
  - Roblox-style physics playground with Three.js

- 🤖 **AI Integration**
  - Auto fuzzers and crash detectors powered by AI
  - Projects like Instagram unfollow bots (for personal use), AI-based CVE finders
  - AI-generated music & YouTube Shorts automation

## 🧠 I’m Currently Exploring

- Writing PoCs for iOS/macOS
- Creating a professional Ghidra-like reverse engineering suite in **Rust, Go, and C++** (in the future)
- Designing Swift packages (e.g. gradients, Mach-O utilities)
- UI/UX experimentation with shaders, blur, glassmorphism, and 3D visuals

## 🧪 Notable Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **IPASigner** | SwiftUI app to sign & inject tweaks into `.ipa` files using ElleKit & zsign-ios |
| **UniGram** | A campus notification app that scrapes university notices & alerts users |
| **Alony** | Skyblock-style customizable island game in the browser using Three.js |
| **Mach-O Analyzer** | iOS app for parsing and inspecting Mach-O headers using MachOKit |
| **No-JIT Hooking Blog** | Writing technical blog posts on bypassing JIT restrictions on iOS |
