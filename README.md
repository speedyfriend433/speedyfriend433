Hey, I'm **Jian**. I like breaking iOS security mitigations and building weird tools with Swift.

My main focus right now is the **Apple Security Bounty** program—hunting logic bugs, kernel issues, and writing PoCs. If I'm not in a debugger, I'm probably rewriting a tool in Rust or C if possible

### Recent Security Research
*   **CVE-2025-46280** (Assigned Dec 2025)
    *   *Impact:* [Soon]
    *   *Description:* [Soon]

### The Tech Stack
*   **Reversing:** IDA Pro, Ghidra, Hopper Disassembler
*   **Dev:** Swift (SwiftUI), C
*   **Focus:** No-JIT hooking, Mach-O parsing, Sideloading iPA

### Projects
*   **IPASigner** – Sign & inject tweaks into `.ipa` files on the fly.
*   **ReDyne** – Attempting to build a proper native decompiler for iOS.
*   **APKRunner** – iOS app for running native APKs (Work in Progress).
*   **UniGram** – Simple app to scrape and push university notifications.
