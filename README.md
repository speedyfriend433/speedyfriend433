# 👨‍💻 speedyfriend67

Hi! I'm **speedyfriend67** — a curious iOS reverse engineer, creative Swift developer, and bug bounty hunter 🧪. I explore Apple internals, make PoCs, design custom tools, and build security-focused apps from scratch. Always learning, always shipping.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 🍎 **iOS Security Research**
  - Bug bounties via Apple Security Bounty program
  - Reverse engineering with IDA Pro & Ghidra
  - Mach-O parsing, No-JIT hooking, kernel fuzzing, and PoCs

- 🧰 **iOS App Development**
  - Building SwiftUI apps for iOS: from IPA signers to UniGram (campus notification app)
  - Tools for Mach-O analysis, IPA injection, and APK Runner
  - Using ElleKit, zsign-ios, MachOKit, and more

---

## 🧠 I’m Currently Exploring

- Writing PoCs for iOS/macOS
- Creating a professional Ghidra-like reverse engineering suite in **Rust, Go, and C++** (in the future)
- Designing Swift packages (e.g. gradients, Mach-O utilities)
- UI/UX experimentation with shaders, blur, glassmorphism, and 3D visuals
